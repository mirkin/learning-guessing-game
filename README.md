Learning Guessing Game
======================

My 7 and 8yr old kids are really getting into programming their Raspberry Pi computers. I remember coding a game like this when I was a similar age well over 30 years ago, and being inspired how my program learned and got better even after I'd finished coding it.

I've started out with Python but we'll do it in other languages too and there is a tutorial on [GurgleApps.com](http://gurgleapps.com)
